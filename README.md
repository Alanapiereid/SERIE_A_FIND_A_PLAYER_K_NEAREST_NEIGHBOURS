# SERIE_A_FIND_A_PLAYER_K_NEAREST_NEIGHBOURS

`This is a Streamlit app`

`Enter a Serie A player's name, get a player with most similar characteristics back. Transfermarkt has this feature but I wanted to put it together myself. This uses Euclidean distance.`


`I love the Italian Serie A so this is a program for finding players who are similar based their number of performances, assists, goals scored and cards but NOT their position.`

`Transfermarkt provided the initial dataset via Kaggle.`

`Players are grouped based on performance data and some physical characteristics like age and height.`
