# SERIE_A_FIND_A_PLAYER_K_NEAREST_NEIGHBOURS

I love the Italian Serie A so this is a program for finding players who are similar based their number of performances, assists, goals scored and cards but NOT their position.

Transfermarkt (who provided the initial dataset via Kaggle) do this already but I wanted to create my own solution. I also guess that a player's position in the main determinant in Transfermarkt's clustering.

I essentially wanted to see would players from the same position be grouped together in clusters based on performance data and some physical characteristics like age and height.
